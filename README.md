# localedit
### Purpose
This graphical tool is intended to make editing localization files easier for the game [APB Reloaded](http://gamersfirst.com/apb/).
At the moment, the scope of the project only includes editing files `MissionTemplates` and `TaskObjectives`, since they're the most repetitive and annoying to work with.

I decided to make this to learn the Qt framework for C++. Not sure if I'll actually maintain it.

### Downloads
